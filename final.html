    <h1>Map of COVID-19 Cases</h1>
    <h3>My story will be about the COVID-19 pandemic. A map of the USA will show the amount of COVID-19 cases around the country. States with current outbreaks will be highlighted in deeper color, while states with less cases will have less color. This will do a great job showing where cases are. This is very important because people need to know this information. It has been covered before but there are so many possibilities with the map.</h3>
